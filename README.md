# Total-Capture
some source code link for the paper:Total Capture: A 3D Deformation Model for  Tracking Faces, Hands, and Bodies
# model
we have build up a model like smpl_hf:https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/research_fields/virtual-humans ,we call it mafa (mano,flame,pca),the model shared is defective version ,you guys can make it better .![image](https://github.com/Myzhencai/Total-Capture/blob/master/moxing.png)The perfect version![image](https://github.com/Myzhencai/SMPL-X-expressive-body-capture/blob/master/result.png)![image](https://github.com/Myzhencai/Total-Capture/blob/master/zuihou.png) ![image](https://github.com/Myzhencai/Total-Capture/blob/master/last.png)we have make it will be used for paper,we will share it later .The model is very simple as SMPL.Because the code for the model have license issue we just share the link:http://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/ to get the code and share the changes of the code![image](https://github.com/Myzhencai/Total-Capture/blob/master/model.png) ![image](https://github.com/Myzhencai/Total-Capture/blob/master/pca.png)for the model('mafainittestfinalallweight.pkl').we can not push it in github  so  we put it in googledrive:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k0xCTKA904RuL7H4CMuXRdBYmM7mRyy_/view?usp=sharing
### Here are some links for the source code you need for the implemetion of the paper

face:https://github.com/patrikhuber/4dface.git
skeleton：https://github.com/Myzhencai/openpose.git
keypoint：https://github.com/timctho/VNect-tensorflow.git
render：https://team.inria.fr/perception/projects/mixcam-project/
according to the paper we surf the internet and find some matirial that can almost make the paper come to real 
please refer the reference doc for it.


### Here are some links show cool use of the code

### The result of taking apart the body mesh ,cause we only need to modify the head and the hand so we will refine the code to make it more convenient:

Do not be upsad , I just provide the source the imagine belongs to you ,amigo.Have fun ,keep legal to license :-).
